Phile
=====

A Markdown file-based CMS.

### Origins

This project is based on [Pico CMS v0.8](https://github.com/gilbitron/Pico/commit/aa59661ff81dd52c3a2596988372a214b0fc31b9 "0.8 Commit") by [Gilbert Pellegrom](https://github.com/gilbitron).

The desire to fork the project from Pico, came when a few community members wanted to contribute more and increase the rate of development progress.
